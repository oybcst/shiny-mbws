# shiny-mbws
RShiny for Watershed
- A draft [shiny-mbws is online at shinyapps.io](https://lisalenorelowe.shinyapps.io/shiny-mbws)

The file "preprocess.R" shows how I made dataframes for R Shiny with the initial Excel spreadsheets in the [Watershed Notebook](https://github.com/oybcst/watershed-simulated-vs-observed).

All the data is exactly the same because there was just data for one station and I copied it to all the stations.

To try it, and modify:
- git clone or download contents of the repo
- Open R Studio
- Go to the directory containing the files
- When you open ui.R, global.R, or server.R, there will be a button "Run App", instead of the usual "Run".
- Then hopefully you just hit "Run App" and it works, and looks like the one on shinyapps.io.

The names are weird because this just starts with shiny_mb and hacks away.  Here is shiny_mb
- [shiny_mb on shinyapps.io](https://lisalenorelowe.shinyapps.io/shiny-mb/)
- [Code for the shiny_mb](https://github.com/oybcst/shiny-mb)

And here is another example, Lake Erie, I don't have it on github yet, but again, it's pretty much the same thing.
